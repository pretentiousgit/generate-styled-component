## Generate Styled Component

This is a bone-dry simple CLI tool to generate component folders for `styled-components` in the React ecosystem. They follow an 'export index' pattern so can be imported normally, using the `import Componend from '../components/Component` import pattern.

### Installation

Clone this directory and then, from within that directory, `yarn install -g` or `npm install -g`.

### Running Script

Once installed, the script provides the `newComponent` command to your CLI. This can be renamed for your own covenience at line 17 of the `package.json`
